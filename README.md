Regular Folks: You need to simplify terms, provide step-by-step instructions, and avoid overwhelming them with complex details.

## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
**For Beginners:**

Use simple language and avoid jargon.

Provide detailed step-by-step instructions.

Include visuals like screenshots or diagrams.

Focus on advanced features and technical details.

Use industry specific terminology.

Skip basic explanations unless necessary.
## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
 Surveys or feedback . Ask users what they know.
 Check FAQs and support questions . See what confuses users the most.

Screenshots: Demonstrate software interfaces or steps.
Videos: Provide step-by-step tutorials or demonstrations.
